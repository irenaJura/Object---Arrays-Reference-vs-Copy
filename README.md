### Reference or copy?

This repo will teach you the difference between strings, numbers and booleans, arrays and objects, when it comes to coping and referencing.

Strings, numbers and booleans can be copied and changed without influencing the originals.

However, when you create new objects and arrays from the originals, changing the copy WILL also change the original.

See the console to get the full picture and ways to avoid this.
